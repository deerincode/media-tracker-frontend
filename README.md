# Media Tracking App (Front-end)
## Introduction
This is the front-end of a full MERN stack application. The app is designed to allow the user to create collections of different media (movies, videogames, albums, etc). Each model can contain various details about the specific kind of media (title, release year, creators, etc), reviews/notes about the media, and tracking for if the piece of media has been watched/played/etc. The current build has full CRUD functionality for both Movie and Videogame models.
